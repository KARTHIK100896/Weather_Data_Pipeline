Project Name: Weather Data Pipeline
Description:

As a beginner in Data Engineering and Python, I wanted to take a hands-on approach to solve a real-world problem. Since it was a bit hot in Tamil Nadu, I decided to put my skills to use by building a weather data pipeline that pulls live weather data from an API, processes it, and visualizes temperature trends over time.

Features:
API Integration: Fetches hourly weather data (temperature) using the Open-Meteo API.

Data Processing: Parses and splits date-time data into separate date and time columns.

Visualization: Plots a temperature vs time graph using Plotly for interactive analysis.

Database Interaction: Stores processed weather data into a MySQL database for future use.

Technologies Used:
Python (requests, pandas, plotly, sqlalchemy, pymysql)

MySQL (for storing processed data)

Plotly (for creating interactive visualizations)

APIs (Open-Meteo API)

Motivation:
Given the hot weather in Tamil Nadu, I thought this would be a great project to put my Python and Data Engineering skills to the test. This project allowed me to dive deep into data collection, data transformation, and visualization, while gaining hands-on experience in API usage and database interaction.
